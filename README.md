This is the TCore Client JS/TS SDK for web applications

## How to run tests on local machine

This will come bundled with (WIP) a dev enviornment on which the TCore Backend along with some other supporting API(s) will be hosted on for testing.

The provided dev env is identical in pretty much all ways to the local api, which will be running on phones with TecTone23 Operating System or their TCore backend
